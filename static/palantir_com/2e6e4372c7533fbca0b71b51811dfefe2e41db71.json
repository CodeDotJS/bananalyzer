As a Defense Tech Software Engineer Intern, you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir's Defense products. Palantir's defense product vertical builds mission-critical products for the modern warfighter, enabling them to securely integrate and visualize their data, perform rich analyses, and build sophisticated, full-fledged programs such as common operating pictures, alert-triaging inboxes, and resource allocation planning tools driven by rich-ML models. Our customers use our defense offering to drive core operations within their organizations - these programs are relied upon for daily operations in the command centers and battlefronts of militaries across the world.\n\nPalantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a Defense Tech Intern - you will be supporting work specifically focusing on delivering our Palantir Defense capabilities to our most critical mission partners. You’ll be involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping. You’ll be paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. \n\nSWE principles include: \n\n•  Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.\n•  Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.\n•  Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team.\n\nTechnologies We Use\n\nIt doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university TA, switched to CS recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:\n\n•  Varying languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend\n•  Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, Elasticsearch, React, and Redux\n•  Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub\n\n","descriptionHtml":"<div><b><span style=\"font-size:18px\">A World-Changing Company</span></b></div><div><br /></div><div>Palantir builds the world’s leading software for data-driven decisions and operations.

In this role, you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Apollo, or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll also have the opportunity to learn about other business areas.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping, to execution and shipping, all while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties.\n\nSWE principles include:\n\n•  Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.\n•  Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.\n•  Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team.\n\nTechnologies We Use\n\nIt doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us; what matters is that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university Teaching Assistant, switched to computer science recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem.

You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll also have the opportunity to learn about other business areas.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping, to execution and shipping, all while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties.\n\nSWE principles include:\n\n•  Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.\n•  Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.\n•  Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team.\n\nTechnologies We Use\n\nIt doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us; what matters is that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university Teaching Assistant, switched to computer science recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:\n\n•  A variety of languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend\n•  Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, Elasticsearch, React, and Redux\n•  Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub\n","descriptionHtml":"<div><b style=\"font-size:18px\">A World-Changing Company</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Palantir builds the world’s leading software for data-driven decisions and operations.

Our customers use our defense offering to perform rich analyses that drive core operations within their organizations - these programs are relied upon for daily operations in the command centers and battlefronts of militaries across the world. </div><div><br /></div><div>This is a frontend engineering role focused on application development for our defense product offering, where you will be responsible for crafting the applications that organizations use every day to keep their countries safe. You will be architecting and developing interfaces to make sophisticated, data-intensive workflows both powerful and approachable, including to non-technical users. You may spend one day talking to users to better understand their needs and identifying product gaps to improve. The next day, you might find yourself putting that customer context to use and brainstorming how to handle intricate UX needs with your teammates. You’ll regularly face sophisticated technical problems, requiring you to scope out the solution design and finding an incremental path to shipping the new features. As part of this, you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code, and work with backend engineers in developing them together. You’ll be constantly exploring new horizons and building new skills in service of real world needs: between type theory, operational transforms, 2D and 3D mapping, UI design systems, high-scale graphics rendering, evidence-based performance optimization, and the never-ending need to decompose user asks into rich, sophisticated, and maintainable software, there is always a new challenge to be faced.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b style=\"font-size:18px\">Core Responsibilities</b></div><div><br /></div><div>As a frontend engineer working on our defense product offering, you will be involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping.</div>","lists":[{"content":"<li>Build for high-scale, collaborative, geospatial workflows (<a href=\"https://palantir.highspot.com/items/646ccc59a8597170f9609759?lfrm=shp.2\" class=\"postings-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gaia</a>) </li><li>Design sophisticated frameworks to enable complex workflows across applications in a single workspace</li><li>Develop the next generation of real-time collaborative tooling and data-analysis solutions (<a href=\"https://www.palantir.com/offerings/defense/secure-collaboration/capabilities/\" class=\"postings-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secure Collaboration</a>)</li>","text":"Some examples of product work you could work on are:"},{"content":"<li>Typescript and React are central to our frontend development.</li><li>Blueprint as a re-usable frontend component library.</li><li>A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand.</li><li>Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, GitHub, and CircleCI.</li>","text":"Technologies We Use"},{"content":"<li>Passion for building user interfaces that enable users to tackle their problems.</li><li>Ability to work optimally in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, e.g. brainstorming and iterating with product designers</li><li>Skill and comfort working in a constantly evolving environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.</li><li>Experience building high-quality software in a fast-paced CI/CD development environment</li><li>Proven ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.</li><li>Ability to learn new technology and concepts, even without in-depth experience.

Our customers use our defense offering to perform rich analyses that drive core operations within their organizations - these programs are relied upon for daily operations in the command centers and battlefronts of militaries across the world. \n\nThis is a frontend engineering role focused on application development for our defense product offering, where you will be responsible for crafting the applications that organizations use every day to keep their countries safe. You will be architecting and developing interfaces to make sophisticated, data-intensive workflows both powerful and approachable, including to non-technical users. You may spend one day talking to users to better understand their needs and identifying product gaps to improve. The next day, you might find yourself putting that customer context to use and brainstorming how to handle intricate UX needs with your teammates. You’ll regularly face sophisticated technical problems, requiring you to scope out the solution design and finding an incremental path to shipping the new features. As part of this, you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code, and work with backend engineers in developing them together. You’ll be constantly exploring new horizons and building new skills in service of real world needs: between type theory, operational transforms, 2D and 3D mapping, UI design systems, high-scale graphics rendering, evidence-based performance optimization, and the never-ending need to decompose user asks into rich, sophisticated, and maintainable software, there is always a new challenge to be faced.\n\n\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a frontend engineer working on our defense product offering, you will be involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping.\n","descriptionHtml":"<div><b style=\"font-size:18px\">A World-Changing Company</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Palantir builds the world’s leading software for data-driven decisions and operations.

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll also have the opportunity to learn about other business areas.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping, to execution and shipping, all while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success.
